# CSGO-CFG-FPS
This .cfg file has been developed to optimize the frames per second (FPS) in your CSGO game.
# Installation
To install the program, follow these steps:
  1. Copy the file to the Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg/ folder on your computer.
  2. Add the autoexec option in the Steam CSGO launch options:
  ```shell
     +exec autoexec.cfg
  ```
This will ensure that the .cfg file is loaded automatically every time you start the game, thus ensuring FPS optimization. Make sure to save the changes before playing.
